# ExpJavaScriptMVC

At the time being, without plans to develop the C part ... 

This is a framework for building Dynamic Web Applications using only Javascript code
(no server code!). The server should work fine with the super-powerful webserver
that is started with: python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Check a live working example at http://fabriceleal.github.io/ExpJavascriptMVC/index.html

Currently waiting for some time; I have to rewrite the mvc.js, as I need to have
access to the node and the data at once, and for now it is impossible :(
